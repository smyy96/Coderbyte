```
Counting Minutes
Have the function CountingMinutes(str) take the str parameter being passed 
which will be two times (each properly formatted with a colon and am or pm) 
separated by a hyphen and return the total number of minutes between the two times. 
The time will be in a 12 hour clock format. For example: if str is 9:00am-10:00am 
then the output should be 60. If str is 1:00pm-11:00am the output should be 1320.

```
Palindrome
Have the function Palindrome(str) take the str parameter being passed 
and return the string true if the parameter is a palindrome, (the string 
is the same forward as it is backward) otherwise return the string false. 
For example: "racecar" is also "racecar" backwards. Punctuation and numbers 
will not be part of the string.

```
Simple Adding
Have the function SimpleAdding(num) add up all the numbers from 1 to num.
For example: if the input is 4 then your program should return 10 because
 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. For the test cases, the parameter num will be any
number from 1 to 1000.
