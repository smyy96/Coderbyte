```
Counting Minutes
Have the function CountingMinutes(str) take the str parameter being passed 
which will be two times (each properly formatted with a colon and am or pm) 
separated by a hyphen and return the total number of minutes between the two times. 
The time will be in a 12 hour clock format. For example: if str is 9:00am-10:00am 
then the output should be 60. If str is 1:00pm-11:00am the output should be 1320.
```
