```
Counting Minutes
Have the function CountingMinutes(str) take the str parameter being passed 
which will be two times (each properly formatted with a colon and am or pm) 
separated by a hyphen and return the total number of minutes between the two times. 
The time will be in a 12 hour clock format. For example: if str is 9:00am-10:00am 
then the output should be 60. If str is 1:00pm-11:00am the output should be 1320.

```
Palindrome
Have the function Palindrome(str) take the str parameter being passed 
and return the string true if the parameter is a palindrome, (the string 
is the same forward as it is backward) otherwise return the string false. 
For example: "racecar" is also "racecar" backwards. Punctuation and numbers 
will not be part of the string.

```
Simple Adding
Have the function SimpleAdding(num) add up all the numbers from 1 to num.
For example: if the input is 4 then your program should return 10 because
 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. For the test cases, the parameter num will be any
number from 1 to 1000.

```
Run Length
Have the function RunLength(str) take the str parameter being passed and
 return a compressed version of the string using the Run-length encoding
algorithm. This algorithm works by taking the occurrence of each repeating
 character and outputting that number along with a single character of the
 repeating sequence. For example: "wwwggopp" would return 3w2g1o2p. The
string will not contain any numbers, punctuation, or symbols.

```
Simple Mode
Have the function SimpleMode(arr) take the array of numbers stored in
arr and return the number that appears most frequently (the mode). For
example: if arr contains [10, 4, 5, 2, 4] the output should be 4. If
there is more than one mode return the one that appeared in the array
first (ie. [5, 10, 10, 6, 5] should return 5 because it appeared first).
If there is no mode return -1. The array will not be empty.
